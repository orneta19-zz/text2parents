# text2parents
Classifies whether Twitter users are parents according to their tweets and bio.


(Does not contain the regex list)

Disclaimer: The text used to identify users' gender and parental status is based on research of thousands of real tweets by real users and words that the users chose to use to describe themselves.
It does not reflect how I personally view people's genders or status, or the words I would choose to describe different people's statuses and genders.
It also does not include all possible options to classify all different genders, only the basic 'female' and 'male'. It includes the data I obtained in the research of a sample of a few thousands of tweets in a specific time frame.
